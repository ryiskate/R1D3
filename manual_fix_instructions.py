This is not a script to run, but rather a set of instructions for manually fixing
the views.py file on the server.

Follow these steps to manually fix the issue:
"""

# Step 1: Create a backup of the current views.py file
"""
cd /home/R1D3/R1D3/strategy
cp views.py views.py.bak_manual
"""

# Step 2: Open the views.py file in an editor
"""
nano views.py
"""

# Step 3: Add the missing import at the very top of the file
"""
from django.shortcuts import redirect
"""

# Step 4: Save the file and exit
"""
In nano:
- Press Ctrl+O to write the file
- Press Enter to confirm
- Press Ctrl+X to exit
"""

# Step 5: Restart the web app
"""
touch /var/www/R1D3_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py
"""

# Alternative approach: If the above doesn't work, use this one-liner
"""
sed -i '1i from django.shortcuts import redirect' /home/R1D3/R1D3/strategy/views.py && touch /var/www/R1D3_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py
"""

# If you need to restore from backup:
"""
cp /home/R1D3/R1D3/strategy/views.py.bak_manual /home/R1D3/R1D3/strategy/views.py && touch /var/www/R1D3_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py
